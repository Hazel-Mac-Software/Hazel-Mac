## What is Hazel Mac?

Hazel Mac is built for users who want reliable **[file automation](#)** on macOS without constant manual sorting. It watches folders and applies rules that organize files automatically—keeping downloads, documents, and project folders clean and predictable.

The core workflow is based on **[folder rules](#)**: define conditions and actions such as moving, renaming, tagging, archiving, or cleaning up old items. This turns repetitive housekeeping into a background system that runs consistently.

Hazel Mac supports broader **[workflow automation](#)** by helping teams and individuals maintain structure over time. It’s especially useful for busy desktops, shared workspaces, and any setup where clutter slowly builds up and wastes attention.

By automating the small tasks that add up, Hazel Mac improves focus and reduces friction—so your folders stay organized and your workflow stays smooth without extra effort.
